                    <p>I have good knowledge of html, including a new features of html5.
                        I have been working with html for one year, in the begining it was
                        just a hobby, but then it turned into something more substantial.
                        I started with the development of simple landing pages for my friends.
                        Then i realized that this topic interests me more than just a development
                        lending, and i went on!</p>

                    <p>Of course we all know that CSS does not happen without HTML :)
                        In this study CSS properties began about the same time that and HTML.
                        The more information I learned - there are more web development opens
                        the curtain for me. Not to say that the study was given to me very easy,
                        but all aspects of the design are subject to the usual logic in understanding
                        the essence of this once - then could only draw information and assimilate it.
                        After six months of studying the layout - I realized that I was not enough ...
                        and I went on!</p>

                    <p>At the stage of the study JavaScript all was more fun and interesting!
                        This is a very flexible language with great potential. At this stage the
                        curtain developing web applications and sites opened for me the greatest
                        extent. As you will know more and more the development of the mysteries in
                        your hands are powerful tools that you can use on many - how much you will
                        have enough imagination. I love what I do and in the future i plan to subdue
                        all new heights IT!</p>

                        At the stage of studying the layout such means for me began: preprocessor LESS,
                        without which it is very difficult to appear to work with cascading style sheets,
                        and of course all the famous Bootstrap, with which you can build a website as a
                        constructor! At this stage in the study of JavaScript I, quite successfully,
                        I am mastering the jQuery library. The future plans of study of the client and

                Faculty of aircraft. <strike>Study was boring and tedious</strike> Institute years were probably the most fun and
                carefree times! Diploma of higher education I received in 2014, after 5 years of study. After
                graduation was the question of further action, work and life in general) to think about what would
                be the pros, I did not come immediately, it took nearly two years trying to find their place.

                the expansion of suggested its features, or to be more precise - in the direction of
                JavaScript. In November 2016 I started a course on JavaScript in itschool - SourceIT,
