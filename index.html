                    <p>I have good knowledge of HTML, including a new features of HTML5.
                        I have been working with html for one year, in the began it was
                        just a hobby, but then it turned into something more substantial.
                        I started with the development of simple landing pages for my friends.
                        Then i realized that this topic interests me more than just a development
                        lending, and I went on!</p>

                <div class="css skill">
                    <img src="image/skills/css.png" alt="CSS">
                    <p>Of course we all know that CSS does not happen without HTML :)
                        Studying of CSS properties began about the same time that and HTML.
                        The more information I learned - there are more web development open new frontiers
                        for me. Not to say that the study was given to me very easy,
                        but all aspects of the design are subject to the usual logic in understanding
                        the essence of this once - then could only draw information and assimilate it.
                        After six months of studying the layout - I realized that I was not enough ...
                        and I went on!</p>

                    <p>At the stage of the study JavaScript all was more fun and interesting!
                        This is a very flexible language with great potential. At this stage the
                        new frontiers of web developing opened for me the greatest
                        extent. As you will know more and more development mysteries, in
                        your hands are powerful tools that you can use so many - as much you will
                        have enough imagination. I love what I do and in the future i plan to subdue
                        all new heights IT!</p>

                    <p> At the stage of studying the layout such means for me began: pre-processor LESS,
                        without which it is very difficult to appear to work with cascading style sheets,
                        and of course all the famous Bootstrap, with which you can build a website as a
                        constructor! On JavaScript courses I successful have learned the jQuery library and module builder webpack.
                        In the future, I plan to study client framework Vue and server-side Node.js.</p>

            <p>Let's start in order :) I started my way in high school â„–55 Kharkiv.
                The school with mathematical bias, which I finished in 2009. Then, in the same year I went
                to National Aerospace University  "Kharkiv Aviation Institute" at the
                faculty of aircraft. <strike>Study was boring and tedious</strike> Institute years were probably the most fun and
                carefree times! Diploma of higher education I received in 2014, after 5 years of study. After
                university was the question of further action, work and life in general. To think about career in IT
                I did not come immediately, it took nearly two years trying to find my place.
                My studying IT started with the usual interest, to be continued...</p>

                project, which course I studied thoroughly. After I learned to
                write unpretentious Landing and in general met with the layout, I started to look towards
                the expansion of suggested its features, or to be more precise - in the direction of
                JavaScript. In November 2016 I have started a course JavaScript in it school - SourceIT,
